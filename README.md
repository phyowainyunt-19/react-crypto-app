## Reflection

This was a week long project built during pendamic breakout and military coup (May 2022). Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to look over crypto prices and news. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `antdesign` , `redux` , `redux toolkit` , `axios` , `chart.js` , `html-react-parser` , `millify` , `moment` and `react-chartjs-2`. I use `Coinranking` and `bing news` api from Rapid API, make sure you subscribe these before you start running the application.

One of the main challenges I ran into was react-router-dom version changes and rapid api premium problem TwT.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, Chart, Data, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
