## Reflection

This was a week long project built during pendamic breakout and military coup. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to look over crypto prices and news. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `antdesign` , `redux` , `redux toolkit` , `axios` , `chart.js` , `html-react-parser` , `millify` , `moment` and `react-chartjs-2`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was react-router-dom version changes.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Redux, Chart, Data, and a significant amount of JSX and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
